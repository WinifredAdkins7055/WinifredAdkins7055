## Hi there 👋

Welcome! 👋 I’m an AI developer with a keen interest in the intersection of voice technology and intelligent systems. This repository represents a part of my ongoing journey in building voice assistants powered by speech recognition and natural language understanding.

My work focuses on designing voice-first interfaces that enable more intuitive and human-like interactions with machines. I’m particularly interested in how speech recognition technologies can be combined with AI models to create systems that not only understand what users say but also respond in meaningful, context-aware ways.

In this space, I explore tools and frameworks that support voice command processing, audio input handling, and real-time transcription. I enjoy experimenting with different speech-to-text engines, integrating NLP pipelines, and refining dialogue flows that feel natural and responsive. Whether it’s setting up wake word detection, customizing language models, or handling complex user intents, I approach each challenge with curiosity and a focus on usability.

This repository includes projects, prototypes, or utility functions developed to solve common challenges in voice AI development. You’ll find clean, modular code with documentation aimed at helping others learn or contribute. I’m always open to collaboration, feedback, or even a good conversation about the future of voice interfaces.

Thanks for stopping by! Whether you're here to browse, learn, or contribute, I hope you find something valuable. Let’s continue pushing the boundaries of how humans and machines communicate. 🎙️🤖
